# Detection Model


## Environment
The code should run under the environment of YOLOv8(https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), and the version is 8.1.25. 
Put the our block code into the YOLOv8 environment's block python file then you can easily use it to construct our RPD-YOLO model by yaml config with our model architecture Figure.
